# Facebook Ads
LookML files for a Facebook block compatible with [Stitch](https://www.stitchdata.com/integrations/facebook-ads/).

To use this block, you will need to:

1. Replace the connection name in the model file or create a facebook_connection user_attribute.
2. Replace the schema name in each view file with your Facebook integration's schema name or create a facebook_schema user_attribute.


For a reference of all of the fields names and definitions reference Facebook's API [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights/fields/v2.12).
